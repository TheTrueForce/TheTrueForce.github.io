# Friday Evelyn Kataran
### Dragonflight

Friday Kataran was born to a Markham and Giezel Kataran. He appeared to be a tiefling, and she appeared to be an elf. Neither were what they seemed; her father was sired by an Archon and born to an Elf, and her mother was a full-blooded Silicon Dragon.

Friday was raised unaware of her draconic and archonic natures, but as she aged, they began to come forth in force; the dragon first, and the celestial later. This is Friday as she comes into the full measure of her draconic power, but before her celestial heritage begins to show itself properly.

- \* Note: Mechanically, Friday is an Amethyst Dragon, due to the breath weapon and the psionic abilites. She is flavoured as a Silicon Dragon, based on the appearance of refined silicon and large-feature-size ICs, like EPROMS. Funnily enough, the Amethyst Dragon is a surprisingly good fit for post-Friday silicon dragons to start with...

## Traits

### Ambition: Prowess/Respect  
"I have found myself in a world without the prejudice I once suffered.  
I will become great in this place. I will be both famous and infamous for my great deeds. I will create mighty works that, while they will surely be forgotten in time, will last thousands of years.  
I will ply my trade, and become the greatest master gunsmith the world has ever seen. Mighty warriors, Kings, Emperors, and maybe even lesser gods will come to me, and I will forge for them mighty weapons; the very best of their kind.  
I will go to the stars. I will blaze the trail, I will pave the way, and my people shall walk and fly among the stars, because of what I have done.  
The name and deeds and works of Friday Kataran will ring through history, long, long after I am dead."

### Obsession: The Works of Man
Friday will collect great works, but especially weaponry, armory, and tools of warfare.

### Age Category: Wyrmling

#### Ability Score Increase
You can increase four ability scores of your choice by 1. The same ability score can be increased multiple times using this feature.

#### Ability Score Maximum
Your maximum for any ability score is 21.

#### Natural Weapons
Your claws, bite, and tail are powerful natural weapons, which you can use to make attacks. The damage of these attacks is based on your size, as shown in the Features by Constitution table. You use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls with your natural weapons.
You can choose to attack with one of your natural weapons each time you take the Attack action.

#### Natural Armor
While you are not wearing armor, your AC is equal to 17.
Senses. You have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet, and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

#### Age Restricted
While you may grow in power through combat experience, you cannot advance to 7th level until you reach the next age category, becoming a young dragon.
To advance your age category, you must be 6th level and have a hoard upon which your entire form can rest comfortably, equivalent in value to the entire holdings of a wealthy noble.
The DM determines exactly how much you need to form this hoard. When you have met these prerequisites, you must hibernate with your treasure hoard for a period of time determined by the DM, rapidly maturing your body. At the end of your hibernation, you awaken as a young dragon of your species.

### Age Category: Young
At 7th level, you have grown in size and power, becoming a young dragon. As a young dragon, you gain the following features.

#### Ability Score Increase
You can increase four different ability scores of your choice by 2.

#### Ability Score Maximum
Your maximum for any ability score is 25.

#### Natural Armor
While not wearing armor, your AC is equal to 18.

#### Senses
You have blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

#### Age Restricted
While you may grow in power through experience and adventuring, you cannot advance to 13th level until you also advance your age category, becoming an adult dragon. To become an adult dragon, you must be 12th level and have a hoard of equivalent value to a monarch’s royal treasury. The DM determines exactly how much that is. When you have met these prerequisites, you must slumber with your treasure hoard for a period of time determined by the DM, rapidly maturing your body. At the end of your hibernation, you awaken as an adult dragon of your species.

### Draconic Instinct: Cunning
You stalk your prey from the shadows, striking with frightening speed. While not wearing armor, your AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier, and your speed is calculated as though you were one size category larger than your normal size accord ing to the Speed column of the Features by Constitution table.

Additionally, your natural weapons are considered finesse weapons, and you are proficient in Dexterity saving throws.
Finally, your dragon save DC is calculated as follows:
- Dragon save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

### Hoard
A dragon’s hoard is essential to its growth and health, and you must maintain your hoard to advance as a dragon. The area where you keep your hoard is considered your lair, which you must safeguard against would-be thieves. Starting at 1st level you should work with the DM to determine the location of your lair. You may relocate your lair later. If you are playing in a dragonflight, you must decide where to house your collective, working together to amass a hoard larger than any of you could achieve alone.
Your hoard is more than treasure—it is a part of you. As you advance in levels and grow in age, the area around it may gain special magical properties befitting your species. The details of these effects and their impact on you are detailed in chapter 4.

### Family Trait: Psionic Power: Telekinesis
You can telekinetically manipulate unattended objects within 300 ft. of you. To do so, you must use your action to seize control of the object, which cannot weigh more than you do. While manipulating an object in this manner, you can expend your movement to move the object a distance through the air equal to the movement expended. A creature within reach can attempt to free a telekinetically manipulated object from your influence by taking an action to succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check versus your dragon save DC. While you manipulate an object in this manner, you must concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell), and the effect ends if the object is ever more than 300 ft. from you.

### Dragon Paradigm: Arcanist

All dragons are magical beings, but only some can tap into the tremendous reservoir of arcane energy flowing beneath their scales. These rare few are Arcanists and are among the most wondrous and mysterious of dragonkind, sculpting the world with their powerful magics. Capable of laying waste to an entire army without lifting a claw, Arcanists also use their magic to explore new worlds, safeguard their hoards, and influence lesser beings.

#### Arcanist Spellcasting
When you reach 2nd level, you add the ability to cast spells to your already formidable draconic abilities. Your spellcasting follows the standard 5th Edition rules, with a few exceptions.

##### Draconic Magic
Spells you cast using this spellcasting feature can be cast without the need for somatic components, nor material components without a listed gp cost. Your maximum reach for touch spells is the same as your reach for your Bite attack.  
You have an Arcanist spell list from which you choose which spells you know.  
The Arcanist Spellcasting table shows the number of cantrips you know, the number of spells of 1st level or higher you know, your maximum spell points, and the maximum level of spell you can cast, all based on your Arcanist level.  

##### Cantrips
You know a number of cantrips of your choice, based on your Arcanist level.

##### Spell Points
The Arcanist Spell Point Cost table shows how many spell points you must spend to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of spell points according to the table.  
Casting spells at a higher level requires an expenditure of additional spell points to match a spell of that level. You cannot increase the level of spell using spell points to a level higher than your maximum spell level. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

##### Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher
You know a number of Arcanist spells of your choice, based on your Arcanist level.
Whenever you gain a level in the dragon class, you can replace two of the Arcanist spells you know with other spells of your choice from the Arcanist spell list. The new spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
- The requirement for these spells to be on the Arcanist spell list has been waived.

##### Spellcasting Ability: CHA
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Arcanist spells, as your magic flows from within your body, called forth by your force of personality. You use your Charisma modifier whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Arcanist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Arcane Jaws
At 2nd level, when you score a hit with your Bite attack, you can expend a number of spell points up to your character level to deal bonus damage of your energy type to the target in addition to the attack’s normal damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for every 2 spell points you expend.

#### Spellflurry I
I: At 6th level, when you cast a spell with a casting time of an action, you may take a bonus action and expend 3 spell points to cast a cantrip.  
II: At 9th level and again at 14th level, when you use a bonus action to cast a cantrip in this manner, you can expend 3 additional spell points to cast an additional cantrip as a part of that action, to a maximum of three cantrips at 14th level.

#### Mystical Heritage
At 10th level, the latent magic within you becomes ever present, influencing creatures and the environment around you. You gain the Change Shape feature, and either the Beguiling Presence, Magical Senses, or Mysterious Stranger feature.

#### Change Shape
As an action, you can magically polymorph into a humanoid or beast with a challenge rating no higher than your character level or back into your true form. You revert to your true form if you die. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (your choice). In a new form, you retain your alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, and the Change Shape action. Additionally, if you have them, you retain your Legendary Resistance, lair actions, Beguiling Presence, Magical Senses, and Mysterious Stranger features. Your statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
Additionally, while you are in the form of a humanoid, you retain your Spellcasting feature, regardless of the effect used to assume your new form.

#### Magical Senses
When you touch an object, you instantly learn about its nature as though you had cast the spell identify and targeted the object. Additionally, you can smell the presence of magic within 60 feet of you. If you smell magic in this way, you can use your action to learn the exact location of the source along with its school of magic, if any.

### Energy Type: Force

### Damage Immunities
You are immune to the type(s) of damage your breath weapon deals (determined by your species).

### Multiattack II
I: Beginning at 4th level, when you take the Attack action, you can make one attack with your Bite or Tail, and one with your Claw.  
II: At 9th level, when you take the Attack action, you can make one attack with your Bite or Tail, and two with your Claw.  
III: At 14th level, when you take the Attack action, you can make one attack with your Bite, two with your Claw, and one with your Tail.  

### Feat: Dragonsong
You are a student of the ancient and powerful magic of dragonsong which commands terrific power over non-dragons, granting you the following benefits.
- You are proficient in Performance.
- As an action, you can begin singing in magical dragonsong. Every non-dragon creature of your choice within 300 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your dragon save DC or become cursed for as long as you continue to sing and the creature can hear you. While cursed in this manner, a creature takes psychic damage equal to your character level each time it makes an attack or casts a spell. On each of your turns, you must use a bonus action to continue singing. The song ends if you are incapacitated.

### Feat: Channel Breath
You can channel your breath weapon for extended periods of time, though at great personal cost.
When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to channel it. When you do so, you continue to exhale your breath weapon into the affected area for 1 minute or until you become incapacitated. On each of your turns while you exhale in this manner, you must use your action to continue the effect. When you do so, you cannot take any other actions.
Additionally, you can change the orientation of your breath weapon when you move on your turn, subjecting any creatures caught in the effect that have not been affected by your breath weapon that turn to the breath weapon’s effects.
Once you have used your breath weapon in this manner, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
