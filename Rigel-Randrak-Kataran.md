# Rigel Randrak Kataran
Silicon Dragon

Rigel trained as a diplomat, and has a moderate amount of experience in this profession, mostly working as a negotiator for Isistia. He has not yet had time to develop the fearsome skill his kind are known for.

Will avoid going into detail about Friday (in particular, he will avoid identifying her), but will not hide why he is trying to establish his own name. Has picked up some firearms knowledge just by being around Friday for long enough.

# Features
## Racial Features
6 HP

### Breath Weapon
As a standard action, a dragonkin can breathe a 30-foot cone of flame that deals 1d6 fire damage. At 3rd level, a dragonkin adds 1-1/2 × his character level to the damage. A creature in the cone can attempt a Reflex save for half damage (DC = 10 + half the dragonkin’s character level + his Constitution modifier). A dragonkin can’t use this ability again until he has taken a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.

### Draconic Immunities
Dragonkin are immune to sleep effects and gain a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against effects that cause paralysis.

### Draconic Vision
Dragonkin gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision, meaning they can see in dim light as if it were normal light.

### Partner Bond
A dragonkin can form a permanent bond with one willing non-dragonkin creature. Once this bond is made, a dragonkin cannot form another partner bond unless its current partner dies. A dragonkin and its partner can communicate with each other as if they both had telepathy with a range of 100 feet. In combat, when a dragonkin is within 30 feet of its partner, both creatures roll initiative checks separately and treat the higher result as the result for both of them.

## Theme Features
### Theme Knowledge (1st Level)
You move about in the highest echelons of galactic society. Your status allows you to know who’s who among the wealthy and powerful of the galaxy, from which families are on the rise and which are on their way down to how to dress for a barathu social event and which set of tongs to use for the kalo wandfish dish in the third course of brunch. Reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about the aristocracy, wealthy and powerful families, prominent personalities, and etiquette by 5. Choose either Bluff or Diplomacy. The chosen skill is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to checks with your chosen skill. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Charisma at character creation.

### Connection (1st Level)
**Melophile**  
You’re able to hear the soundless melody that drives all observable astronomical objects in the universe, a resonating delight that brings tears to the eyes of those capable of hearing it. You might be a mathematician, seeking to translate a soundless rhythm to audible harmony, or a traveling minstrel looking to share the socalled Song of the Spheres with any who care to listen.

### Healing Touch (Su) (1st Level)
Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level. 

### Song of the Spheres (Su) (Melophile, 1st Level)
You act as a conduit for the mystical Song of the Spheres, inspiring your allies with the hymns of creation. As a move action, you expend one mystic spell slot or spend 1 Resolve Point (your choice). All allies within 60 feet gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, as well as a +1 morale bonus to saves against charm, compulsion, and fear effects. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot that you expended. If you spent a Resolve Point, this effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the highest level of mystic spell you can cast. This is a mind-affecting, sense-dependent effect.

# Backstory
The legendary Friday Kataran has had many sons and daughters over her long, long life. One of these is Rigel.

Rigel is one of the sons of a legendary dragoness, and has ended up being stuck in the shadow of his mother, measured by the standard of her blown-out-of-proportion reputation.
He has struck out on his own to make his own name, and sought adventure. In pursuit of this, he has found himself drawn to the Pact Worlds.

Late one night, while he was alone and awake, he heard it:
A melody of notes he never thought possible. An aria of grand majesty, on such an indescribable scale, that it was beyond full comprehension, even for a full-blooded dragon.
The Music of the Rolling Spheres was revealed unto him in all its full glory and majesty.
For but a moment, he saw his part in the Grand Theme. His part to play in the Great Symphony of the Cosmos.

He knew where he needed to be. Suskillon. And he had just enough time to get there.
